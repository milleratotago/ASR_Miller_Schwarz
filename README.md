# ASR_Miller_Schwarz_R
R software for use with the Activation Suppression Race (ASR) model.

Routines are provided for
* fitting the model to existing sets of RTs from congruent and incongruent conditions.
* generating model predictions of PDFs, CDFs, and delta plots for a given set of model parameters.

These R routines are limited to the version of the model with
processes A & B having exponential finishing times
and with process C having Gaussian finishing times.

For MATLAB software that will handle other possible finishing time distributions
for processes A, B, & C (i.e., not just exponential and Gaussian),
see https://github.com/milleratotago/ASR_Miller_Schwarz_M
